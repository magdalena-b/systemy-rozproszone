<h1> Lyrics </h1>
It&#x27;s in the trees
It&#x27;s coming

When I was a child, running in the night
Afraid of what might be
Hiding in the dark, hiding in the street
And of what was following me
Now hounds of love are hunting
I&#x27;ve always been a coward
And I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for me

Oh, here I go
It&#x27;s coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me, someone, help me, please
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
And I&#x27;ll be
Two steps on the water

I found a fox, caught by dogs
He let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beat so fast
And I&#x27;m ashamed of running away
From nothing real, I just can&#x27;t deal with this
I&#x27;m still afraid to be there
Among your hounds of love
I feel your arms surrounding me
I&#x27;ve always been a coward
And never know what&#x27;s good for me

Oh, here I go
Don&#x27;t let me go
Hold me down
It&#x27;s coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me, darling, help me, please
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
And I&#x27;ll be two steps on the water

I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for me
I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for me
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah
Yeah, yo-, yeah, yo-your love
Take your shoes off and throw them in the lake
Do you know what I really need?
Do you know what I really need?
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah
